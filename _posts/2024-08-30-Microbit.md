## Quick Overview

We are going to be going over the Microbit V2 Go board and we'll be discussing some of the problems that I have faced and also how to install and run an application using TockOS.

## Introduction

First, we'll be covering what we get out of the box and that is the battery and the board. If you want to connect to it, you just a micro usb cable(which is not included).

## Micropython and Microbit IDE

In order to program this board, there are many different methods. The simplest one is just using the IDE and downloading the compiled `.hex` file. After that, just move the file into the MICROBIT drive and it will automatically flash it for you. As for the programming side, you can either use their block based scripting or micropython, which is mostly python but for embedded systems.
