## Quick Overview

We are going to be going over the Microbit V2 Go board and we'll be discussing some of the problems that I have faced and also how to install and run an application using TockOS.

## Introduction

First, we'll be covering what we get out of the box and that is the battery and the board. If you want to connect to it, you just need a micro usb cable (which is not included).

## Micropython and Micro:bit IDE

In order to program this board, there are many different methods. The simplest one is just using the IDE and downloading the compiled `.hex` file. After that, just move the file into the MICROBIT drive and it will automatically flash it for you. As for the programming side, you can either use their block based scripting or micropython, which is mostly python but for embedded systems.

## Flashing from CLI

Because I'm a stubborn person, I wanted to be able to flash my program from the CLI on my Kali VM. Firt issue that I ran into is that I forgot to add my USB device in Virtualbox.

> In order to do that go to Settings -> USB -> Choose your device from the plus icon and you'll be good to go.

Second issue that I ran into is that my vm doesn't automount the drive so you have to do that manually. Use `lsblk` to see the name of the partition and then go the `/dev`. To mount the partition, create a directory in `/mnt` and name it to whatever you want. After that just use `mount /dev/<partition-name> /mnt/<your-directory-name>`. You should be good to go now.

> Unfortunately, I still faced another issue, and that I is, I've tried to flash as normal user, and so I had to change the permissions on my serial device(```ttyACM0``` in this case) -> ```chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0```
