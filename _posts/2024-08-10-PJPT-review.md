## Introduction

![PJPT Cert Image](/images/_posts/PJPT.png)

I've been eager to take the OSCP for a while now, but I always felt that my understanding of Active Directory wasn't quite where it needed to be. So, when I saw that TCM Security had released a new certification specifically designed for people with little to no experience, I decided to give it a shot. The certification was reasonably priced at the time, so I felt it was a worthwhile investment.

## Course and Labs

The course is a little over 24 hours long, which I believe is more than enough to cover everything a newcomer to cybersecurity should know. Although my main focus was the Active Directory section, I decided to go through the entire course, and I wasn't disappointed. The content is well-structured and provides more than enough information to prepare you for the exam.

## Exam

The exam is 48 hours long, and you have an additional two days to write your report. Personally, I found it easier to write the report as I progressed through the network, ensuring I didn't forget any details. As mentioned earlier, the course content is more than sufficient to pass the exam. The exam itself is engaging, with a difficulty level that's just right for those new to cybersecurity.

## Conclusion

Overall, I would say that both the course and the exam are excellent and cover almost everything a beginner should know about Active Directory. My advice to anyone taking this course is to pay close attention and take notes, as the exam can be challenging without them. Having notes to refer to can make a significant difference in your ability to pass the exam.
