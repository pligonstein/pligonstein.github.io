## **Introduction**

![PJPT Cert Image](/images/_posts/PJPT.png)

I've been long eager to take the OSCP, however I always felt like I wasn't fully prepared when it comes to Active Directory. When I saw that TCM Security had a new certification that was fully for people with less to no experience, I decided I should take it. It wasn't that expensive at the time I bought it so I believe it was a good investment.

## Course and Labs

The course is a little more than 24 hours long, so I do believe that it covers mostly everything that a new-comer into the cybersecurity domain should know. Although I was only interested in tha Active Directory section I thought I should give the full course a try. It was bad at all, I do believe that it was really well structured and it's most than sufficient in order to pass the exam.
