    <h2><strong>About</strong></h2>

    <p>Hi! I'm Denis Vascuta, currently working as a Penetration Tester. 👋 Been passionate about cybersecurity ever since I was in 9th grade. I participated in many CTFs, even took part in ECSC(European Cyber Security Challenge) twice, having the chance to represent my country (Romania).</p>
    <p>My favourite CTF categories are forensics, misc and reverse engineering. I enjoy learning more on Active Directory exploitation and Digital Forensics in my free time. ⚔️🔎</p>
    <p>Through this blog, I share my experiences, insights, and personal achievements. Stay tuned for regular updates and feel free to connect with me!</p>
